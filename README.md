🌐 GSoC 2025 – Creating LLM Examples with JAX and Flax for Beginners
This repository contains beginner-friendly examples of how to build, train, and use large language models (LLMs) using JAX and Flax. It supports my GSoC 2025 project proposal under the JAX and Keras organization, specifically for the KerasHub: Create LLM examples with JAX and Flax project.

🌟 Features  
✅ Educational and minimal LLM implementations with JAX & Flax  
✅ Simple text generation using Hugging Face models  
✅ Clean, modular code structure  
✅ Output files to verify working inference  
✅ Screenshot of generated output included  

🚀 Getting Started
git clone https://github.com/shaikshazia/gsoc-2025-llm-examples.git  
cd gsoc-2025-llm-examples  
pip install -r requirements.txt
