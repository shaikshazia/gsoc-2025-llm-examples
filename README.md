# 🌐 GSoC 2025 – Creating LLM Examples with JAX and Flax for Beginners

This repository contains beginner-friendly examples of how to build, train, and use large language models (LLMs) using **JAX** and **Flax**. It supports my **GSoC 2025 project** proposal under the **JAX and Keras** organization, specifically for the **KerasHub: Create LLM examples with JAX and Flax** project.

## 🌟 Features
- ✅ Educational and minimal LLM implementations with JAX & Flax
- ✅ Simple text generation using Hugging Face models
- ✅ Clean, modular code structure
- ✅ Output files to verify working inference
- ✅ Screenshot of generated output included

## 🚀 Getting Started
